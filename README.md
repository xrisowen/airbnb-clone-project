+ GraphQL – A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. Enhances flexibility in data fetching compared to REST, improving efficiency and performance.

+ Docker – A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into portable units. Ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

+ Jenkins – A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server. Manages build pipelines, testing, and automated deployments for streamlined development.

## Database Design
The Airbnb Clone Project relies on a relational database structure that supports scalability, reliability, and clear relationships between entities. Below are the core entities and their key fields:

Entities and Fields
1. Users
   + id (Primary Key)
   + name (Full Name)
   + email (Unique identifier for login)
   + password_hash (Encrypted password)
   + role (Guest, Host, or Admin)

2. Properties
   + id (Primary Key)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + title (Property name/description)
   + location (City, country, coordinates)
   + price_per_night

3. Bookings
   + id (Primary Key)
   + property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + check_in_date
   + check_out_date
   + status (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)

4. Reviews
   + id (Primary Key)
   + property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + rating (1–5 stars)
   + comment

5. Payments
   + id (Primary Key)
   + booking_id (Foreign Key → Bookings)
   + amount
   + payment_method (Credit card, PayPal, etc.)
   + status (Success, Failed, Pending)

### Entity Relationships
+ A User can act as both a Guest (booking properties) and a Host (listing properties).
+ A User can own multiple Properties.
+ A Property can receive multiple Bookings.
+ A Booking belongs to one Property and one User.
+ A Booking has one Payment.
+ A Property can have multiple Reviews, each written by different Users.

## Feature Breakdown
The Airbnb Clone Project incorporates several core features that replicate the functionality of a real-world booking platform. Each feature is designed to provide seamless interaction between users, properties, and bookings while ensuring scalability and security.

1. User Management
Handles user registration, authentication, and profile management. Users can sign up as guests or hosts, securely log in, and update personal details. This feature also ensures role-based access to functionalities.

2. Property Management
Allows hosts to list, update, and manage their properties. Each property includes details such as location, price, availability, and descriptions. This feature ensures that guests can easily browse and search for properties that meet their needs.

3. Booking System
Enables guests to book available properties with defined check-in and check-out dates. It handles booking requests, confirmation, cancellations, and updates availability in real-time. This ensures efficient resource utilization and prevents double-booking.

4. Review System
Guests can leave ratings and comments for properties they’ve stayed in. Reviews provide feedback for hosts and help future guests make informed decisions. This feature enhances trust and transparency within the platform.

5. Payment Integration
Facilitates secure online payments for bookings. Supports multiple payment methods (e.g., credit card, PayPal) and ensures transactions are processed reliably. Payment records are linked to bookings for accountability and financial tracking.

6. Search and Filtering
Guests can search properties by location, price range, availability, and amenities. This feature ensures users can quickly find accommodations that best match their preferences.

## API Security
Securing the backend APIs is critical to ensure data integrity, protect user privacy, and safeguard financial transactions within the Airbnb Clone Project. The following security measures will be implemented:

1. Authentication
All users must verify their identity through secure login mechanisms (e.g., JWT tokens or OAuth 2.0). Authentication ensures that only verified users can access the platform and prevents unauthorized access.

2. Authorization
Role-based access control (RBAC) will be enforced to determine what actions a user can perform (e.g., hosts can list properties, guests can book). Authorization prevents privilege escalation and protects sensitive operations.

3. Data Encryption
All sensitive data, including user credentials and payment details, will be encrypted in transit (HTTPS/TLS) and at rest (database encryption). This prevents data leaks and ensures privacy.

4. Rate Limiting
APIs will implement request throttling to limit the number of calls a user or IP can make within a time window. Rate limiting prevents abuse of resources, denial-of-service attacks, and brute-force login attempts.

5. Input Validation & Sanitization
All user inputs will be validated and sanitized to prevent injection attacks (e.g., SQL injection, XSS). This ensures only safe and expected data enters the system.

6. Secure Payment Handling
Payment APIs will comply with PCI-DSS standards and rely on secure third-party payment gateways. This ensures financial transactions are handled safely and reduces liability for the platform.

## CI/CD Pipeline
A CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Continuous Deployment) pipeline automates the process of building, testing, and deploying the application. It ensures that new code changes are integrated smoothly, tested thoroughly, and deployed reliably to production environments with minimal manual intervention.

Why It’s Important

+ Consistency: Automates repetitive tasks, ensuring consistent builds and deployments.
+ Faster Development: Enables quick feedback on new code changes, helping developers identify and fix issues early.
+ Reliability: Reduces human error and ensures each change passes automated tests before going live.
+ Scalability: Supports frequent updates, allowing the project to grow and evolve without disrupting users.
+ Collaboration: Enhances team efficiency by providing a shared, automated workflow for developers, testers, and operations.

In this project, the pipeline will likely use Jenkins and Docker to build, test, and deploy the application seamlessly, ensuring code quality and reliability at every stage.
