# Airbnb Clone Project

The Airbnb Clone Project is a backend-stack web application that replicates the core features of Airbnb. It emphasizes backend systems, database modeling, API design, and security best practices, providing hands-on experience in building scalable and production-ready platforms. The project also highlights real-world software development workflows and collaborative team practices.

## Team Roles
The success of the Airbnb Clone Project depends on effective collaboration across different roles within the team. Each member contributes unique expertise to ensure the application is reliable, scalable, and secure.

1. Backend Developer
Responsible for implementing the core logic of the application, including business rules, API endpoints, authentication, and integrations with third-party services.

2. Frontend Developer
Focuses on building the user interface and ensuring seamless user experiences across devices. They consume APIs provided by the backend and implement responsive, intuitive designs.

3. Database Administrator (DBA)
Designs, manages, and optimizes the PostgreSQL database. Ensures data consistency, performance tuning, and backup/recovery strategies for the application.

4. DevOps Engineer
Handles deployment pipelines, CI/CD processes, and containerization with Docker. Ensures smooth releases, monitoring, and scalability using tools like Jenkins.

5. QA Engineer (Quality Assurance)
Tests application features to identify bugs, performance issues, and security vulnerabilities. Works closely with developers to maintain code quality and ensure reliability.

6. Project Manager
Oversees the project timeline, coordinates team activities, and ensures that deliverables align with the project goals. Acts as a bridge between stakeholders and the technical team.

7. Security Engineer
Focuses on securing APIs, databases, and infrastructure. Implements access control, encryption, and best practices to safeguard user data and system integrity.

## Technology Stack: 
The Airbnb Clone Project leverages a modern and powerful set of technologies to build a scalable, secure, and production-ready booking platform. Each tool plays a specific role in ensuring the application’s reliability and performance.

+ Python – The core programming language used for backend development. Provides simplicity, readability, and access to rich libraries for web and data processing.

+ Django – A high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development and clean, pragmatic design. Used for building the backend logic, authentication, and web application structure.

+ Django REST Framework (DRF) – A toolkit built on top of Django to simplify the creation of RESTful APIs. Handles serialization, authentication, and API endpoint development.

+ PostgreSQL – A powerful open-source relational database system used for managing structured data such as users, bookings, and property details. Ensures scalability, reliability, and advanced querying.

+ GraphQL – A query language for APIs that allows clients to request only the data they need. Enhances flexibility in data fetching compared to REST, improving efficiency and performance.

+ Docker – A containerization tool that packages the application and its dependencies into portable units. Ensures consistency across development, staging, and production environments.

+ Jenkins – A continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) automation server. Manages build pipelines, testing, and automated deployments for streamlined development.

## Database Design
The Airbnb Clone Project relies on a relational database structure that supports scalability, reliability, and clear relationships between entities. Below are the core entities and their key fields:

Entities and Fields
1. Users
   + id (Primary Key)
   + name (Full Name)
   + email (Unique identifier for login)
   + password_hash (Encrypted password)
   + role (Guest, Host, or Admin)

2. Properties
   + id (Primary Key)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + title (Property name/description)
   + location (City, country, coordinates)
   + price_per_night

3. Bookings
   + id (Primary Key)
   + property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + check_in_date
   + check_out_date
   + status (Pending, Confirmed, Cancelled)

4. Reviews
   + id (Primary Key)
   + property_id (Foreign Key → Properties)
   + user_id (Foreign Key → Users)
   + rating (1–5 stars)
   + comment

5. Payments
   + id (Primary Key)
   + booking_id (Foreign Key → Bookings)
   + amount
   + payment_method (Credit card, PayPal, etc.)
   + status (Success, Failed, Pending)

### Entity Relationships
+ A User can act as both a Guest (booking properties) and a Host (listing properties).
+ A User can own multiple Properties.
+ A Property can receive multiple Bookings.
+ A Booking belongs to one Property and one User.
+ A Booking has one Payment.
+ A Property can have multiple Reviews, each written by different Users.
